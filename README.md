# CS255-DriverPass

DriverPass as a client was a pre-existing company looking to get more public outreach via the use of the internet.
Providing more in depth driver training for what they saw as a market with a hole to fill.
They wanted a system for their users to have access from anywhere at anytime.  This system was tasked to allow for a User to
view and edit their schedule.  Pick custom learning packages, interact with live comments given by drivers and access tests/classes
for improved learning.  Taking into account all the actors/user groups was my strong point.  My work on the diagrams was rough.  I found myself over complicating use cases and their flow.  I would make improvements by simplifying my use Cases and respective functions.
The users needs were met with the desired functionality.  Viewing and editing their schedule, profile editing, location personalization, and package choice were all user oriented.  A user will be the one interacting with the system and if they don't like the system why would they use it?  If a user wasn't focused whats the point of the system in the first place?  Software has a slow approach the begins with data collection from interviews and proceeds into diagramming for functionality before finally putting a problem to code.  I will use use case diagrams/class diagrams in the future.
